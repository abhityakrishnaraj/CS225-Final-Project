Week of November 8

● We initially met up to work on the team contract and started working on ideas for the

proposal. We decided on using the open flights' database for the location and I ATA codes

of airports for 40 cities around the world and creating our own database of flight routes

from flightsfrom.com. We decided upon 40 cities based on their population, air traffic,

and tourism statistics. We created a proposal based on these databases to visit 40 cities

around the world in the least amount of time, based on an inputted start point.

Week of November 15

● Based on the initial feedback from the TA we came up with a revised proposal that

tackled problems that were actually solvable and more within our capabilities. We revised

our proposal to include using a shortest path algorithm, giving two cit to travel to and

from, and making the minimum spanning tree for the chosen 40 cities. We didn’t have

that much time to meet or work during the week due to midterm and other events taking

place.

Week of November 22

● Thanksgiving week, but we created the routes dataset in a table format and parsed and

cleaned the open flights database for the data we needed for the project.

Week of November 29

● Worked through the initial stages of development for djikstra's algorithm and the importation

of data from csv files into usable vectors in code. Also created the baseline gif for showing

off the routes taken for the shortest path between two places and added some quality of life

improvements for users inputting cities into the code. Some problems did rise up for both the

creation of the algorithm and the importation of data but they were resolved in the group

meeting. Also had the mid- point presentation this week that went ok.

Week of December 6

● The group was separated into two teams to work on the Algorithm part and Graphing part of the 

code. Both teams had pretty much completed the allotted task by the following meeting. The 

algorithm group was able to take in user input and generates a shortest path consisting of

the city indexes. The graphing team was taking in the list of airport codes and were able to

generate a PNG file that connected the given airport codes together and a GIF file that

precisely indicated how the path develops. During the meeting the teams came together to properly

integrate together the two parts to produce the final PNG/GIF output from an input consisting of

a start point and end point. We also all worked together to start working on the final powerpoint

presentation.

Week of December 13

● We finalized our code while fixing some bug issues related to edge cases and certain user inputs. 

For example, fixing issues regarding entering cities that are more than 1 word long and fixing BFS 

traversal issues where it would not go to the correct destination because we read in the data as one 

line too short causing random generation to be put in place instead of actual data points. In addition, 

we worked on the presentation for the project and its supporint documentation such as the ReadMe and the 

Results page.
