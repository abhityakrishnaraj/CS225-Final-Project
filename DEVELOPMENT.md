● We initially met up to work on the team contract and started working on ideas for the

proposal. We decided on using the open flights' database for the location and I ATA codes

of airports for 40 cities around the world and creating our own database of flight routes

from flightsfrom.com. We decided upon 40 cities based on their population, air traffic,

and tourism statistics. We created a proposal based on these databases to visit 40 cities

around the world in the least amount of time, based on an inputted start point.

● Based on the initial feedback from the TA we came up with a revised proposal that

tackled problems that were actually solvable and more within our capabilities. We revised

our proposal to include using a shortest path algorithm, giving two cit to travel to and

from, and making the minimum spanning tree for the chosen 40 cities. We didn’t have

that much time to meet or work during the week due to midterm and other events taking

place.

Week of November 22

● Thanksgiving week, but we created the routes dataset in a table format and parsed and

cleaned the open flights database for the data we needed for the project.
