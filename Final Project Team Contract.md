Team Contract (tongwei3 - abhitya2 - seohyec2 – yusongw2)

Communication

1. Team Meetings: We will meet once a week from 3-5 PM on Wednesdays in

Grainger Library. We will have general meeting notes taken by all the group

members, each of us writing tasks and ideas to implement for the upcoming

week and giving feedback on the other members' work the past week. The team

will also complete the DEVELOPMENT LOG during the meeting.

2. Assistance: We can all communicate with each other through emails, our group

chat, or other forms of social media. We will try to get back to one another within

24 hours.

3. Respect: We will try to listen and take everyone’s opinion into account at

meetings. There will be unanimous votes required for any major change within

the project, but majority votes will suffice for any small changes or tweaks to

tasks or etc.

Collaboration

1. Work Distribution: At each meeting, the team will decide upon tasks for the week.

Each member will have the opportunity to select one of the tasks based on their

skill sets and if more than one member wants a task it will be randomly assigned.

Overall performance will be kept track of so that each team member's workload

will be balanced.

2. Time Commitment: To ensure an equal distribution of work, each member of the

team will spend no less than 2 hours a week and no more than 6 hours a week. If

someone’s deliverable is not completed prior to the meeting, a small section of

the meeting will be spent on a collaborative effort to complete the task. Any

person who consistently fails to produce results at meetings will be in breach of

this contract. The team member will first be made aware of the situation and then

will be required to attend a mandatory meeting between team members in order

to find a solution. If not possible, further contact will be made with the TA.

3. Conflict Resolution: Conflict between two or more members will be decided by

majority vote, if the vote is tied 2-2 the conflict will be resolved by coin flips or a

non-involved third party member.
